Logitech-Dual-Action-Lynx-Controller
====================================

This code maps a Logitech Dual Action controller to a standard 6-DoF Lynx Robot, allowing any user to easily control the robot's movements. It also has a memory system, in which positions may be stored during operation, to later be replayed in sequence.
